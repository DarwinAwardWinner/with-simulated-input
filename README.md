# with-simulated-input

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DarwinAwardWinner/with-simulated-input.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DarwinAwardWinner/with-simulated-input)
<!-- (Not in MELPA yet) [![MELPA Stable](https://stable.melpa.org/packages/with-simulated-input-badge.svg)](https://stable.melpa.org/#/with-simulated-input) -->

This package provides an Emacs Lisp macro, `with-simulated-input`,
which evaluates one or more forms while simulating a sequence of input
events for those forms to read. The result is the same as if you had
evaluated the forms and then manually typed in the same input. This
macro is useful for non-interactive testing of normally interactive
commands and functions, such as `completing-read`.

For example:

```elisp
(with-simulated-input
    "hello SPC world RET"
  (read-string "Say hello: "))
```

This would return the string `"hello world"`.

## Simulating idleness

Some interactive functions rely on idle timers to do their work, so
you might need a way to simulate idleness. For that, there is the
`wsi-simulate-idle-time` function. You can insert calls to this
function in between input strings. For example, the following code
will return `"hello world"`.

```elisp
;; Insert "world" after 500 seconds
(run-with-idle-timer 500 nil 'insert "world")
(with-simulated-input
    ;; Type "hello ", then "wait" 501 seconds, then type "RET"
    '("hello SPC" (wsi-simulate-idle-time 501) "RET")
  (read-string "Enter a string: "))
```

Note that this code only *pretends* to be idle for 501 seconds. It
actually runs immediately.

In fact, you can put any lisp code in between input strings
in this way.

## Running the tests

This package comes with a test suite. If you want to run it yourself,
first install the [cask](http://cask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
dependency manager. Then, from the package directory, run `cask
install` to install all the development dependencies, in
particular
[buttercup](https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/emacs-buttercup).
Finally, to run the tests, execute `cask exec buttercup -L .`. You
should see something like this:

```
$ cask exec buttercup -L .
Running 17 specs.
